# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java

This repository demonstrates a common Java programming error: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `bug.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element beyond its valid index range, resulting in this exception.

The `bugSolution.java` file provides a corrected version of the code, illustrating how to prevent this exception by properly handling array boundaries.

This example highlights the importance of careful index management when working with arrays in Java and other programming languages. Always ensure that array indices are within the valid range (0 to array.length - 1).
